The code is very bad and unpolished, probably lots of bugs, but it works well for me, proceed with caution.

### How to build

1. Clone the repository and copy all the files into the 4Coder directory
2. Build by running the "build4coder.bat"
   
For release build use the command line:

```
build4coder.bat release
```
